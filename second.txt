How does the Spotify Premium trial work?
If you've never had Premium before, you may be eligible for a free (or reduced rate) trial.

For trials, you'll still need to enter a valid payment method to sign up. We'll use this to confirm your country or region and take payments if you want to keep Premium after the offer ends.

We'll send you a reminder 7 days before your trial ends. Country restrictions and Terms apply
